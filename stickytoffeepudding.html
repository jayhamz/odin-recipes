    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>While the exact origins are a bit murky, sticky toffee pudding is a decidedly British dish. Multiple people and restaurants throughout the 20th century across the country claimed to have created the popular dessert, but most have been disputed. While sticky toffee pudding has a reputation for being an old-timey dessert, it wasn’t until the 1970s that it really became popularized.</p>
    <p>Because no one knows exactly where sticky toffee pudding was created, it’s unclear how the addition of dates was added, but it’s certain you can’t make the recipe without them.  While you can’t distinguish the flavor of dates once it’s baked, they add a rich, almost caramel-like flavor to the sponge. Dates also keep the sponge moist, which is crucial to absorbing the toffee sauce.</p>
    <p><em>Fun fact: In New Zealand and Australia the dish, is called sticky <strong>date</strong> pudding!</em></p>

        <li>1 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>

        <li>Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, for serving!</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <h5>Make the Cake:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 6 tablespoons unsalted butter in the bowl of a stand mixer (or large bowl if using an electric hand mixer). Place 2 large eggs on the counter. Let both sit at room temperature until the butter is softened.</li>
        <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350˚F. Coat a 9x9-inch square baking dish with butter.</li>
        <li>Place 8 ounces pitted dates and 1 teaspoon baking soda in a medium bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over the dates and let stand until softened, about 10 minutes. Scrape the date mixture into a food processor fitted with the blade attachment and process until puréed, 20 to 25 seconds.</li>
        <li>Wipe the bowl the dates were in dry. Place 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg in the bowl. Whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>Add 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar to the bowl of butter. Beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until combined, about 1 minute. Add 1 of the eggs and beat on medium speed until combined, then add the second egg and beat until just combined. Add the date purée and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract and beat on medium speed until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the mixer.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture to the date mixture and beat on the lowest speed until just combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Transfer the batter to the baking dish and smooth into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake until the cake is set and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Immediately use the tines of a fork to poke holes all over the cake, poking all the way down to the bottom and spacing the pokes about 1/2-inch apart.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Make the Sauce:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 stick unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 1 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar, 1 cup heavy cream, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Stir until smooth and glossy, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat. Drizzle 1 cup of the sauce over the warm cake. Return the pan to the oven and bake until the sauce bubbles, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with flaky salt if desired. Serve the toffee pudding hot with the remaining sauce and vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
