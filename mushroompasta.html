   <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
   <p>This mushroom pasta recipe is all about the creamy sauce and just letting the ’shroomies do their big savory umami thing.</p>
   <p>For the most robust flavor, use a variety of mushrooms like feathery maitakes, meaty oyster mushrooms, and woodsy shiitakes. Be sure to garnish the dish with red pepper flakes and extra Parmesan cheese! Serve with a big caprese salad or toasted foccacia garlic bread.</p> 
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 lb. mixed mushrooms (such as maitake, oyster, crimini, and/or shiitake), torn into bite-size pieces</li>
    <li>2 medium shallots, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 lb. fettucine or bucatini</li>
    <li>1/2 cup heavy cream>
    <li>1/3 cup finely chopped parsley</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>1/2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about ½ cup), plus more for serving</li>
    <li>Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Directions</h4>
   <ol>
    <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium-high. Cook half of mushrooms in a single layer, undisturbed, until edges are brown and starting to crisp, about 3 minutes. Give mushrooms a toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until all sides are brown and crisp, about 5 minutes more. Using a slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to a plate; season with salt. Repeat with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil and mushrooms and more salt.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and return all of the mushrooms to the pot. Add shallots and cook, stirring often, until shallots are translucent and softened, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions.</li>
    <li>Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with mushrooms and add cream and 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Increase heat to medium, bring to a simmer, and cook, tossing constantly, until pasta is al dente and liquid is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove pot from heat. Add lemon zest and juice, parsley, butter, ½ oz. Parmesan, and lots of pepper and toss to combine. Taste and season with more salt if needed.</li>
    <li>Divide pasta among bowls and top with more Parmesan.
   </ol>
