    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>How do you feel about Brussels sprouts? Do you love them, or hate them? Over the last few years, I feel like they’ve been getting more and more popular, and I couldn’t be happier about it! Brussels sprouts are some of my favorite fall veggies – they’re fresh and healthy, but still hearty, and they pair well with all sorts of seasonings. But, in my opinion, the key to loving Brussels sprouts is preparing them the right way. No one’s clamoring for more boiled or steamed sprouts – they’re often bitter, and they have an unappealing mushy texture.</p>
    <p>So if you’re still on the fence about them, try this roasted Brussels sprouts recipe! They come out of the oven with golden brown centers and crackly, crisp outer leaves. I love them straight off the sheet pan, but when they’re dressed with this easy Lemon, Thyme, and Parmesan seasoning, even the biggest Brussels sprouts skeptics can’t resist them.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lemon Parmesan seasoning <em>(optional)</em></h4>

        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus 2 teaspoons zest</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or ¼ cup shaved</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley leaves, for garnish</li>
        <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425° and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Slice the Brussels sprouts in half, toss with drizzles of olive oil and pinches of salt and pepper, and spread on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast 20 to 30 minutes or until tender and golden brown around the edges. <em>Note: the exact timing will depend on the size of your sprouts.</em></li>
        <li>If desired, toss the roasted Brussels sprouts with the lemon juice, zest, Parmesan, and thyme leaves. Garnish with parsley and red pepper flakes.</li>
    </ol>
